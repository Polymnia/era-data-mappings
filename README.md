# era-data-mappings

RML mappings for the ERA project

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Java JRE

## Execute mappings

The mappings can be executed using the `map-turtle.sh`  or `map-ntriples.sh` scripts. These scripts will run the mapping process for all the YARRRML files present in the `mappings/` folder. The resulting Linked Data files will be stored in the `knowledge-graph/` folder.

```bash
./map-turtle.sh
```
